                <p class="section-container-spacer">Kurt Bodiker founded Bayline Solutions, LLC, located in Severna
                    Park,
                    Maryland, after 23 years of experience doing DevOps and Software Engineering. Kurt's experience
                    began when he joined the U.S. Air Force as a Communications-Computer Systems Programmer. After 8
                    years
                    of active
                    duty service, Kurt first transferred into the Air Force Reserve and then into the Maryland Air
                    National Guard where he finished his career and retired with 20 years of honorable service as
                    a Cyber Operations Superintendent. Today, Kurt continues his career as a DevOps Engineer supporting
                    federal missions.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Over the course of my career, I've been an integral part in the rapid adoption and
                    evolution of development and deployment strategies employed on teams of various sizes.
                    Before it was called DevOps, those roles and responsibilities fell onto me, usually because
                    I was either the single guy or because I lived closer to work than anyone else. These
                    experiences have helped me learn to critically analyze and assess the mission and it's needs.
                    I don't believe in "one size fits all" solutions. Every mission is unique and so are it's
                    requirements. Let Bayline Solutions help you navigate your mission to success.

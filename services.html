                    <p>Bayline Solutions will help you design the right solution to
                      your problem. Purchasing hardware and software is not an easy task
                      and requires careful consideration regarding data type, lifetime, and
                      storage requirements, uptime requirements, development tools,
                      technologies employed, power, space, and cooling concerns,
                      available rack space, and available budgets. Far too often, the
                      hardware and software being purchased doesn't meet the actual
                      needs of the project. The results can be disastrous -- under-/over-powered
                      equipment, slow processing or query speeds, unreliable access to data,
                      and misused budget dollars.<br></p>

                      <p>Bayline Solutions is here to assist you throughout the entire
                      acquisitions process. We'll work with you to ensure the right hardware
                      and software are purchased and effectively employed.<br>
